# wavelength_frequencies

Overview of Project:
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) implementation designed for hyperspectral wavelength distributions. 

Dependencies:
The libraries used to built the model are:
- Tensor flow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Image loading, augmentation, and normalization.

Model Architecture: A deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Training & Evaluation: Model training, validation, and performance metrics.

Visualization: Graphs and plots for loss, accuracy, and predictions.

How to Run:
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Install required dependencies.

Open Jupyter or Google Colab and Run the code.

Run the cells Sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

Output:
The metrics absolute error, root mean square error, and r square error comes as an output.

Future Improvements:
- This model can be improved by usiing Hyperparameter Tuning.

- By doing Data Augumentation enhancements.

- Deployment in the cloud by using Flask or Streamlit.
